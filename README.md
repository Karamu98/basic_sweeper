I want a PS5

# Why
I like making tools and this is pretty fun to learn, plus, I want to learn Node JS more so even better excuse

# How to use
Simply paste in the URL of your website then pick an element that'll disappear when the product is in stock, this could be something like \<div id="sold-out-banner">. 
When this element is no longer on the page, the process will end and the website will be loaded up in browser.
  
If the page uses something more than just simple HTML to create their page like react, try use the advanced mode with -a -h in the cmd line or checking the box in the GUI.
